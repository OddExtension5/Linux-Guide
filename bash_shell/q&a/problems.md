# PROBLEMS on BASH Scripting

+ Write a script with the name **totmp**. This script should copy all files of which 
 the names are provided as arguments on the command line to the users home directory.
 If no files have been provided, the script should **read** to ask for file names, and 
 copy all file names provided in the answer to the users home directory.
