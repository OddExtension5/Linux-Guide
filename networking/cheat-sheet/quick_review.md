# What is Networking ?
  
  Networking is used to describe collection of computers which all talks to each others within an office or 
  a group of people trying to contact with each others.
  
  A **computer network** is a group of computers linked to each other that enables the computer to communicate with another computer 
  and share their resources, data, and applications.
  
 **Three components of networking**
      
   + **Medium** ( How are you connetced ? )
   + **Addressing** ( How to do you locate and identify the party ? )
   + **Content** ( What information are you sharing with other parties ? )
   
# Addressing
   
   For uniquely identifying devices on a network an **IP address** is used.
   
   There are presently two IP standards in use :
      
   + **IPv4** Addressing ( old standard )
   + **IPv6** Addressing
