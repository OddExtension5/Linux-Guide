# Networking Terminology

1. **Network Interface Card** :
   
   A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component without which a computer cannot be connected over a network. 
   It is a circuit board installed in a computer that provides a dedicated network connection to the computer. 
   It is also called network interface controller, network adapter, LAN adapter or physical network interface.

2. **Network Protocol** :
   
   Network protocols are sets of established rules that dictate how to format, transmit and receive data 
   so computer network devices -- from servers and routers to endpoints -- can communicate regardless of 
   the differences in their underlying infrastructures, designs or standards.
